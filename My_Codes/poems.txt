Whispers of the Dawn

The morning breaks with gentle grace,
A whisper soft, a warm embrace.
The sky awash in golden hue,
A brand new day, a world anew.

The winds sing songs of lands afar,
The sun ascends, a brilliant star.
Each moment glows, so full of light,
Chasing away the lingering night.

Echoes in the Rain

Beneath the clouds, the world stands still,
A silver mist upon the hill.
Each droplet speaks, a quiet call,
Echoing softly as they fall.

The trees sway gently in the breeze,
A dance that hums between the leaves.
And as the rain begins to fade,
A rainbow's colors are displayed.
